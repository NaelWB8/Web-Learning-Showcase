# Web Learning Showcase

This project was built during my 11th grade year as part of an IT web development assignment.  
What started as a simple collection of class materials evolved into an interactive website that organizes learning content through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The site includes modules in economics and physics, along with example forms and basic scripting — showing how web technologies can make learning clearer and more engaging.
